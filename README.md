# PyCalc

Welcome to **PyCalc**!  
This is my first Python projectâ€”a simple calculatorâ€”created to help me learn the basics of Python programming.

## Why I Made This

I started PyCalc to practice foundational Python skills, including:
- Using variables
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Working with `if` statements and logic
- Type casting (converting between types)

## What PyCalc Does

PyCalc is a command-line calculator that lets you:
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
- Enter numbers and operations via user input
- See results printed out in the terminal

## Key Python Concepts Practiced

- **Variables:** Storing and updating values
- **Arithmetic:** Basic math operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- **If Statements:** Making decisions in code (for example, checking which operation to run)
- **Type Casting:** Converting strings from user input to numbers with `int()` or `float()`

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (https://python.org).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the calculator in your terminal:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## What I Learned

- How to get and use user input
- How to write and debug basic Python code
- How to handle errors (like dividing by zero)
- The importance of clear code and comments

## Next Steps

- Add more operations (like exponentiation or modulo)
- Improve error handling
- Build a graphical interface
